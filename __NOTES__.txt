= TODOS =

- add enum support to Number, Integer and String
- finish additionalProperties support in Object
- compile type constraints into custom subtypes when possible
- figure out how extends should work

== Repository ==

- store the original schema document and the inflated schema object too
    - this removes the need for a deflator
    - perhaps extends should be processed by the inflator?
- support reading in from a file, a url or a directory of files

- ponder being able to load the entire meta-schema instead of having them hardcoded
