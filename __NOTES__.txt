= TODOS =

- Jackalope::Web::Service
    - needs to be able to take multiple schemas
        - can merge the resulting routers

- Jackalope::Web::RouteBuilder
    - add support for link->relation of create
      and described_by, those will be handled
      in a different way
      - probably best to accomplish this with
        subclasses of Web::Route::Target
        - make a factory for Web::Route::Target

- Jackalope.Schema.Repository
    - refactor the compilation process
      to match the Perl version

== LOW PRIORITY ==

- Jackalope.js
    - add some kind of basic Bread-Board type thing

- Jackalope::Schema::Spec & Jackalope.Schema.Spec
    - perhaps use that description cleanup method in GenerateSpec on the actual spec

- Test::Jackalope & Test.Jackalope
    - write .toJSON methods that strip the __compiled_* stuff from the output of schemas
    - validation_fail should also take some kind of
      test to check the right error appears
        - fixtures will need to support this too

- test_fixtures
    - write more of them

- Jackalope::Schema::Validator::Core
    - make it use Moose types to check against

- Jackalope::Serializer
    - Jackalope::Serializer::XML (TODO - perigrin)
    - Jackalope::Serializer::YAML (why??)

== PERHAPS ==

- Jackalope::API::*
    - create a set of roles that can be used
      in the Bread::Board config to typemap
      to concrete classes
    - NOTE: I tried this, it didn't feel right
      but should keep the idea around just in case
